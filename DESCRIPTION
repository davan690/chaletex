Description: Trying to compile LaTeX files can be frustrating when you need to 
      stop at every attempted compile and install the missing packages. The 
      goal of chaletex is to make it easy to extract packages you need to 
      install from LaTeX. It is named `chaletex` as we want this to be like 
      walking into a Chalet after a big day - a nice, friendly, cozy place for 
      your TeX problems.
